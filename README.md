## Main Tools and Technologies Used
## Architecture : ### Clean Architecture + MVVM (Feature-Based) 
The project follows a clean, scalable structure separating concerns into Domain, Data, and Presentation layers for better testability and maintainability.

### Domain: contains business logic and entities.
### Data: handles repositories, models, and local data sources.
### Presentation: contains UI and Cubit classes for state management.

## StateManagement : ### Cubit (from flutter_bloc)
Used for handling app state in a simple yet structured way. Each feature has its own Cubit managing its UI logic and data flow.

## BackEnd : SQLFite
Used for store static data in strucuture way.

## Main packages used

-[dartz] (https://pub.dev/packages/dartz) for functional programming tools like Either and Option

-[flutter_bloc] (https://pub.dev/packages/flutter_bloc) for implementing Bloc state management pattern

-[get_it] (https://pub.dev/packages/get_it) for dependency injection using a service locator

-[go_router] (https://pub.dev/packages/go_router) for managing routing and deep linking in Flutter

-[flutter_staggered_grid_view] (https://pub.dev/packages/flutter_staggered_grid_view) for creating staggered grid layouts

-[flutter_svg] (https://pub.dev/packages/flutter_svg) for rendering SVG images in Flutter

-[flutter_screenutil] (https://pub.dev/packages/flutter_screenutil) for making an app be more reponsive

-[sqflite] (https://pub.dev/packages/flutter_screenutil) for Local Database
